# ENEL-380-Design-Project
Automation and Control Course

For this course, my group designed a parking barrier system for various enclosures, such as parkades. This design was to make use of RFID (radio frequency identification) technology and other sensors and motors. It was to be operated using a PLC (programmable logic controller).
